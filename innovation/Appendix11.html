<h2>How To Test Your Own Propensity To Rebel</h2>

<p>This final appendix outlines a formula that can be used to
predict any individual's likelihood of supporting radical innovations. The
formula builds on the base-rate probabilities given in Table 10. These
predicted probabilities are derived from a logistic regression model for the 28
scientific debates in my study. The table specifies the likelihood that an
individual will support a radical revolution such as Copernican theory or
Darwinism. These probabilities are stratified by age, social attitudes, and
birth order. <a style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.5pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p>To determine an individual's base-rate probability, find
the applicable category in Table 10. For example, a firstborn who is over the
age of sixty and socially conservative has a 3 percent likelihood of endorsing
a radical innovation such as Darwinism. A lastborn who is under the age of
thirty and who is socially liberal, has a likelihood of acceptance of 96
percent.</p>

<p>These base-rate probabilities may be adjusted to take into
account seven additional biographical influences. To the appropriate predicted
probability in Table 10, add or subtract the following percentages, depending
on an individual's attributes:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]><b>Pronounced
parent-offspring conflict.</b> In the case of firstborns who have experienced
pronounced conflict with a parent, add 30 percent to the relevant base-rate
probability in Table 10. &quot;Pronounced parent-offspring 'conflict&quot; may
be defined as more conflict than is found in four-fifths of the<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.5pt'>&nbsp;general population. For laterborns who
have experienced pronounced parent-offspring conflict, add 10 percent to
appropriate base-rate probability in Table 10. For cases in which
parent-offspring conflict (or deidentification) is less extreme, but exceeds
that observed in two-thirds of the general population, these two adjustments
may be halved.</p>

shyness.</b> For firstborns who are shyer than four-fifths of the general
population, add 20 percent to the relevant probability in Table 10. <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.5pt'>For shy lastborns, subtract 15 percent from
the appropriate probability in Table 10. Make no adjustment for middle
children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><![endif]><b>Age gaps between adjacent siblings.</b> For firstborns
whose age gap with their closest sibling is less than 2.0 years or more than
5.0 years, add 5 percent to the base rate probability in Table 10. Only
children may consider themselves to be large-age-gap firstborns. For laterborns
who are less than 2.0 years younger than their next older sibling, or more than
5.0 years younger, subtract 5 percent from the base-rate probability.</p>

</span><![endif]><b>Parental loss and surrogate parenting by older siblings.</b>
If a firstborn has lost a parent before the age of ten and has acted as a
surrogate parent toward younger siblings, subtract 15 percent from the
base-rate probability in Table 10. If a laterborn has lost a parent before the
age of ten and has experienced surrogate parenting by older siblings, add 10
percent to the base-rate probability in Table 10.</p>

</span><![endif]><b>Gender.</b> For females born prior to 1900, add 10 percent
to the base-rate probability in Table 10. Recent studies do not show consistent
gender differences on openness to ideas. Still, women are more politically
liberal than men, and a modest upward adjustment&mdash;  perhaps 5 percent&mdash;  seems
warranted for women in contemporary populations. <a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2'

</span><![endif]><b>Race.</b> For individuals from minority races&mdash;  especially
those subject to discrimination (for example, blacks and Jews)&mdash; add 10 percent
to the base-rate probability in Table 10.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;

</span><![endif]><b>Friendship.</b> If an individual is a particularly good
friend with the leader of a radical revolution, add 10 percent to the predicted
probability in Table 10.</p>

<p>This ten-variable formula for openness to radical
innovation mimics the results of a multivariate logistic regression model. One
should use common sense in applying this model within any particular behavioral
context. For example, during pre-Darwinian debates over evolution, less than a
third of the scientific community endorsed this controversial idea. For the
scientific population as a whole, this mean rate of acceptance for
pre-Darwinian theories of evolution was 30 percent not 50 percent, as Table 10
assumes.</p>

<p>Applied to the participants of a radical controversy, the
formula presented in this appendix will do a good job of rank ordering
participants according to their likelihood of acceptance. On average, the
base-rate formula in Table 10, Section A, should be 75 percent correct in
classifying individuals as supporters or opponents of innovation, as long as
the innovation is truly a Radical Ideological Revolution.<a style='mso-endnote-id:

style='font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></span></a> After making appropriate adjustments to this
base-rate prediction in sections B&mdash; F, the formula's accuracy should approach 85
percent. Fudging on the details will decrease the formula's accuracy.</p>

10 are based on a logistic regression model that includes complete biographical
data on 1,436 participants in 28 scientific controversies (1543-1967). The
model includes four significant main effects: age, social attitudes, relative
birth rank, and ideological implications of the innovation. The model also
includes three significant two-way interaction effects: ideological
implications by age; ideological' implications by social attitudes; and
ideological implications by relative birth rank. All main effects are
statistically significant at p&lt;.0001, and the interaction effects are
statistically significant at p&lt;.005. The two-way interaction effects reflect
the fact that age, social attitudes, and relative birth rank are all
significantly better predictors of receptivity in proportion to the radicalism
of the innovation.</p>

<p>Predicted probabilities in Table 10 are listed only for
those scientific controversies that involved radical ideological implications.
For this class of controversies, the model's predictors yield a multiple
correlation with observed radicalism of .50 (df=l/582, t=13.46, p&lt;\ in a
billion; 75.2 percent correct classifications, based on the 2 X 2 table of
observed versus predicted outcomes). For participants in Technical Revolutions
and Controversial Innovations, the multiple correlation is .31 (rf/=l/482, f=6.38,
p&lt;\ in a billion; 69.0 percent correct classifications). For scientists who
debated Conservative Theories, the multiple correlation is: .10 dy=l/366,
f=1.88, p&lt;.06-, 59.2 percent correct classifications). The chance rate for
correct classifications is 50.4 percent.</p>

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a> For Technical Revolutions and Controversial
Innovations, approximate probabilities derived from the model may be calculated
as follows. For conservative firstborns, multiply the base-rate probability in
Table 10 by 5.0. For socially moderate firstborns, multiply the base-rate
probability by 1.8. For radical firstborns, multiply the base-rate probability
by 1.2. For middleborns and lastborns
who are social conservatives, multiply the base-rate probability by 1.8. For
middleborns and lastborns who are social moderates or liberals, multiply the
base-rate probability by 1.1. In debates over Conservative Theories, firstborns
and social conservatives are more likely than their counterparts to endorse new
ideas. Although young people are more likely to endorse Conservative Theories,
the role of age is significantly less predictive than it is during liberal
innovations.</p>

<p>If you, or someone else, is a clear-cut exception to
the formula's prediction, ask yourself why. The most likely causes of
exceptions will involve some of the influences, especially situational factors,
that are discussed throughout this book. No formula can do complete justice to
all of the contingencies that affect human behavior, although formulas can
include appropriate adjustments for some of these contingencies.</p>
